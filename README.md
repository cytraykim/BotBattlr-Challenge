# week2---BotBattlr-Challenge
# Setup
After unbundling the project:

Run `npm install` in your terminal.

Run `npm run server`. This will run your backend on port 8002

`Run npm start.` This will run your React app on port 8000.

In a new terminal, `run npm start`. This will run your React app on port 8000.

Make sure to open http://localhost:8002/bots in the browser to verify that your backend is working before you proceed!

Sort bots by their health, damage or armor. For this, create a new component, SortBar.

When I enlist a bot it will be removed from the BotCollection and added to YourBotArmy.

Filter bots by their class. We can select a few filters at the same time.

Sort bots by their health, damage or armor. For this, create a new component, SortBar.

Only enlist one bot from each bot_class. The classes are ["Support", "Medic", "Assault", "Defender", "Captain", "Witch"].
